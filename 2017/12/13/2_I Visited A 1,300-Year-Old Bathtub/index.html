But why do so many people want to look at a 1,000-year-old bathtub?"></a><em>Matriarchal neolithic civilizations are badass. But why do so many people want to look at a 1,000-year-old bathtub?</em></h5><p>&nbsp;<br>Xi’an, 756 miles Southwest from China’s current capital Beijing, is the beginning of the Northern Route on the Silk Road, a culinary haven renowned for blending Middle Eastern flavors with Chinese cuisine, and capital to a number of glamorous ancient civilizations. </p>
<p>I’ve had the chance to visit for a weekend during a family trip to China in December. On a Friday night, I hopped on a sleeper train with my mom and woke up seven hours later in a different city. </p>
<p>The plan was to hit up eight sightseeing spots, ambitious given that there were only 48 hours allotted. But we were determined to make the most out of the journey. </p>
<p>Despite my protest, our first stop was Huaqing Hot Springs, a palace complex built around the remains of an imperial bath house graced by Concubine Yang, a woman whose notoriety in Asian culture is like that of Marie Antoinette. Or, if you prefer an analogy more of the zeitgeist, Kim Kardashian. Her love story with emperor Tang Xuanzong is adored by litterateurs and belletrists. Numerous poems have been written to praise her beauty, but even more lament her sumptuous life style and her role in leading the empire into a downfall. In the most well-known one,  it is said that the emperor allegedly ordered lychee fruit be delivered fresh during an 11-day transit by war horses to satisfy her cravings. </p>
<p>Legends ran wild with imagination, but as far as I understand, it’s a messed up story of an emperor who fell in love with his son’s wife, took her as his consort, and spoiled her with luxurious until the people became so angry that they killed her (for the record, there are more than six versions of what happened to her, but no one knows for sure). </p>
<p>The site of the concubine’s bath house remains was filled to the rafters, much to my surprise. People elbowed and fought their way through layers of the crowd for a glimpse at the bath pond, perhaps all weirdly fantasizing the celebrated beauty’s delicate figure as she steps out of a steamy cleansing. It’s in good shape for being over 1,300 years old, but I remain perplexed by its popularity. </p>
<p>Turning the time machine back 700 years, I found myself standing in front of a pit of terracotta warriors in the Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum, the tomb of China’s first emperor 15 minutes by bus from the Huaqing Hot Springs. Like many visitors, I was in complete awe. It’s an impressive army that was installed to protect a despot from enemies in the afterlife. Had it not been for farmers who were digging a well in 1974, the world’s largest pottery figurine group may stay unknown to human civilization for much longer. But that may be a blessing in disguise, as others say that it may have been excavated too early, when the technology for preservation wasn’t ready to handle the colossal find. Buried in vibrant colors, the paint on the figures peeled and flaked within minutes of exposure to the air, leaving only the bare clay. </p>
<p>For military history fans, you could have a blast identifying the formation and various infantries throughout the four pits, imagining yourself commanding the army in the middle of an epic battle, or simply reveling in its might, as I did. When the British Museum brought 12 of the terracotta warriors for display in 2007, the event marked the museum’s most successful exhibition since 1972. 400,000 advanced tickets were sold out so fast that the museum had to extend the hours to midnight. Despite that, many visitors still had to be turned away and the gates shut to avoid overcrowding. </p>
<p>The magnetic pull of the terracotta warriors is as mysterious as their deceased ruler who commissioned them. Tales spoof that Qin Shi Huang’s underground burial site is a labyrinth filled with sinister traps and mercurial poisons to prevent grave robbers from intruding in his afterlife. The main chambers remain sealed, but if anyone had accessed it, the person certainly did not make it out with their life. </p>
<p>Everyone in Xi’an becomes a de facto history junkie, whether s/he knows it or not. It’s hard not to be when you live in such a culturally rich city. The average Xi’an bus driver could tell you about Chinese history more enthusiastically than your professor. I was so affected by their passion, and inspired to understand my roots more. </p>
<p>Turning the pages back another 6000 years, we arrived at the remnants of a neolithic civilization – the Banpo Village, when two college-age volunteers came up and offered a free tour. We gladly accepted. </p>
<p>As part of the Yangshao culture that flourished from 5th to 3rd millennium BC along the Yellow River, Banpo was inhabited for over 1,000 years, but barely expanded beyond a 12-acre terrain. The small community of 200 to 300 people survived on hunting, gathering, simple agriculture, and domesticating animals such as pigs. Inside the 40 or so living units, archaeologists discovered layers of hardened earth, a result of burning to cook or produce heat. </p>
<p>In a millennium, the Banpo people developed sophisticated pottery making skills, and showed signs of funeral ritual practices. For instance, found near the living units were pots with skeletal remains of deceased infants and children preserved inside. It’s speculated that the bodies were kept close so the spirits could visit if they missed their families. On the other hand, adults are buried further away from the living area, but also in specific manners. </p>
<p>On the finely crafted red and black pottery pieces, archaeologists identified 22 unique symbols. Some look like math, some look like letters, but most just look like gibberish. To this day, the writing has not been deciphered. I guess it’s hard to read the mind of a developing homo sapien. </p>
<p>At the site’s excavation in 1953, China was heavily influenced by the Marxist interpretations of historiography, which led the team to quickly conclude that Banpo was a matriarchal society. However, in recent years, as the Marxist thinking loosens its hold and as new research surfaced, there is less certainty over the previous conclusion. It is still being publicized as a “typical” matriarchal village nonetheless, and that is what I decided to work with. Unlike the concubine lady’s bathtub that was brimming with curious onlookers, no one gave shits about a civilization that was possibly <em>ran</em> by women. It was so empty that we practically had the museum to ourselves. All the better for people who are not into tabloid history and don’t want to bother with huge tourist crowds. </p>
<p>So the big question is, between a beautiful, rich lady’s jacuzzi and the site of a thousand years of female domination, which one would you spend money and time to check out? </p>
<p>This is still an entry to a travel blog. A-hem. </p>
<p>Two days went by before I had the chance to visit the Wild Goose Pagoda, the 1,500 year-old Buddhist monument that stores the first Sanskrit sutras brought back from India by the pioneering pilgrim Xuanzang. If you have heard of the 16th century novel <em>Journey to the West</em> (also known as <em>Monkey</em> in the version translated by Arthur Waley), he is the character inspiration for the protagonist monk. If you haven’t heard of it, you are missing out on the epic odyssey where a human, a magical monkey, an annoying pig, and another bearded human with super strength go on the quest for the sutras to achieve enlightenment. There has been a Japanese adaptation, and a Western adaptation of the Japanese one. Netflix had to ruin it. </p>
<p>As a child, I watched the 1986 TV rendition of the novel religiously. I and millions other children had our eyes glued to the screen every summer break for the reruns. It is so popular that major channels still program the series into its slate in 2018, 36 years after the show first aired. Journey to the West marked a defining point in Chinese television. </p>
<p>I said goodbye to the city’s silhouette on Sunday night and headed to the train station. On the waiting platform, steam from the hot bun vendor’s cart rose up against the forest green cars, dissipating into the crowd of migrant workers hurling blue and white woven nylon bags. The scene was so nostalgic of the 1970s China that I’ve only seen in movies, as if the clock has stopped ticking in this particular corner of the world, as if I have been transported back into a less chaotic time. I am definitely coming back to Xi’an. </p>
