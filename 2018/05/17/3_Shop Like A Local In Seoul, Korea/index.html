But they do all wear the same style of makeup. And the same clothes."></a><em>Korean girls don’t all look the same. But they do all wear the same style of makeup. And the same clothes.</em></h5><p>&nbsp;<br>Since I was a middle schooler, I’ve always wanted to see Korea – no, I’m not ashamed to admit that I had a K-pop phase. A pretty intense one too, actually. This year, the country that in half a century transformed itself from a war-torn Japanese colony to the poster-child of consumerism and celebrity culture has finally made it to my list for a long overdue visit. </p>
<p>Shopping is on every girl’s agenda when she comes to Korea. According to the latest data, around 13.2 million tourists spent an estimated $21 billion USD total in 2015, which averages to about $1,607.65 per person. </p>
<p>In 2016, Korea’s installation of THAAD, an anti-ballistic missile defense system that the US deployed as a measure against possible aggression from North Korea and China, has sparked tensions that manifested in economic retaliation from Chinese nationals. As the group that makes up nearly half of Korea’s total tourists, many began calling for citizen-initiated travel embargo. Since then, tourism from China has declined more than fifty-percent. However, a steady and growing influx of Muslim tourists is helping to dampen the effects. The trend translated into more halal food options in tourist-concentrated areas. </p>
<p>An eerily conformist society, all the female passer-bys wore the same color of lipstick, eyeshadow, even the same blouses and skirts. The monotony was strangely contaminating. I bought some Korean makeup and decided to try an experiment. The effects were immediate – the next day, most salespeople spoke to me in Korean; some were even surprised to find that I am not. I suppose that the “like a local” part of the mission has been accomplished, in an oddly literal way. </p>
<p>So after roaming around the city for three days blending in with the general population, I have confirmed that these are the best spots to hit for channeling your inner shopaholic.</p>
<h4 id="COSMETICS-MECCA-Myeongdong"><a href="#COSMETICS-MECCA-Myeongdong" class="headerlink" title="COSMETICS MECCA: Myeongdong"></a><strong>COSMETICS MECCA: Myeongdong</strong></h4><p>From sheet masks to street food, Myeongdong is the Disneyland for shoppers. Discounts on cosmetics are all-year long, but other items tend to be overpriced. However, the variety of merchandise and vibrant atmosphere make this a must-go destination. Most shops accept both cash and some form of card payment. </p>
<h4 id="OUTDOOR-BAZAAR-Ewha-University"><a href="#OUTDOOR-BAZAAR-Ewha-University" class="headerlink" title="OUTDOOR BAZAAR: Ewha University"></a><strong>OUTDOOR BAZAAR: Ewha University</strong></h4><p>Perched around the architectural all-women university campus are boutiques that line the outer streets. In the summer, most clothing items are between 5,000 to 20,000 won, or about $5 to $20 USD, while other more high-end stores sell blouse or skirts upwards of 40,000 won. Some designs can only be seen in the shops here, so be sure to give this location a scout. The merchants accept cash only. </p>
<h4 id="HIDDEN-GEM-Express-Bus-Terminal-Underground-Mall"><a href="#HIDDEN-GEM-Express-Bus-Terminal-Underground-Mall" class="headerlink" title="HIDDEN GEM: Express Bus Terminal Underground Mall"></a><strong>HIDDEN GEM: Express Bus Terminal Underground Mall</strong></h4><p>My friend suggested that we raid this labyrinth crowded with hundreds of cheap clothing stalls and accessories vendors on my last day in Seoul. As its name suggests, the mall is tucked in a bus transfer station. Summer clothes range from 5,000 to 15,000 won, or about $5 to $15 USD. People have said it’s possible to bargain. There is also a food court, so be prepared to stay there all day. Also cash only. </p>
<p>Three and half days quickly passed in browsing. My plan to feast on drool-worthy dudes and walking around in a hanbok in the historic Bukcheon village, however, melted away in the summer heat. But who cares when you can show off to your friends socks with Obama’s face on them? </p>
