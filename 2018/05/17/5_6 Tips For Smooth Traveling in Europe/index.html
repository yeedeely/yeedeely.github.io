But they do all wear the same style of makeup. And the same clothes."></a><em>Korean girls don’t all look the same. But they do all wear the same style of makeup. And the same clothes.</em></h5><p>&nbsp;<br>Having traveled to Europe twice and even lived there for half a year, the continent’s charm seems to only grow with more time spent exploring it. I have put together some basic continent-specific observations from my own experience as well as crowd-sourced wisdom for all you starry-eyed adventurers.  </p>
<h4 id="1-Take-advantage-of-budget-airlines"><a href="#1-Take-advantage-of-budget-airlines" class="headerlink" title="1. Take advantage of budget airlines"></a><strong>1. Take advantage of budget airlines</strong></h4><p>Budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet offer extremely affordable prices to a wide selection of destinations in Europe. A one-way ticket could start as low as 20 euros depending on the demand, which many airlines display on their homepage with charts of price levels throughout the year. Since budget airlines don’t make much money from tickets, they have to find ways to cut down their operation costs and make money. Some important tips for traveling with budget airlines:</p>
<p>a. Check for uncommon rules i.e. if you need to print your boarding pass before arriving at the airport. For instance, Ryanair requires that you print out your boarding pass at home or pay an 80-euro fine.</p>
<p>b. Make sure your luggages fit the limitations set by the airline. This is especially important if you are flying with different airlines on the same trip. Also, unlike regular airlines, most budget flights allow only one item to take onboard per person. </p>
<p>c. Know which airport you are arriving and departing from. Budget airlines can sometimes use obscure locations, such as the case of Ryanair in Paris, where the airport is only reachable from the city by a 1.5-hour long bus ride, so make sure to plan your transportation in advance. </p>
<h4 id="2-Bring-adapters-and-converters"><a href="#2-Bring-adapters-and-converters" class="headerlink" title="2. Bring adapters and converters"></a><strong>2. Bring adapters and converters</strong></h4><p>I recommend the Poweradd 2-Outlet International Travel Charger Power AC Adapter. It is compact, well-built, and its 5 international adapters are compatible with outlets in North America, United Kingdom, Most of Europe (except Italy and Switzerland), Australia, Japan, Most of Africa, Middle East, and Asia. </p>
<h4 id="3-Learn-a-few-phrases-in-the-local-language"><a href="#3-Learn-a-few-phrases-in-the-local-language" class="headerlink" title="3. Learn a few phrases in the local language"></a><strong>3. Learn a few phrases in the local language</strong></h4><p>It can help quickly build rapport in a completely new country where you need to ask for help all the time. Also familiarize yourself with local customs, especially those that are significantly different from your own culture. Or, download the Google translate app.  </p>
<h4 id="4-Pack-light"><a href="#4-Pack-light" class="headerlink" title="4. Pack light"></a><strong>4. Pack light</strong></h4><p>Versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down make your best travel outfits. Bring lots of accessories. Also, don’t forget to pack some medicine for common illnesses like colds, sore throat, headache, upset stomach, and minor cuts. There are many useful videos on YouTube about how to pack the most items in a carry-on. </p>
<p>This is optional depending on the length of your trip, but a useful addition I learned about from other fellow travelers is the SeaToSummit packable towel. It is super lightweight, dries in a few minutes, and can be folded and packed into a pouch the size of a sunglasses case. For about $25, the packable towel would free up a lot of space and lighten up the load for those who plan to trudge. </p>
<h4 id="5-Beware-of-pickpockets-and-scams"><a href="#5-Beware-of-pickpockets-and-scams" class="headerlink" title="5. Beware of pickpockets and scams"></a><strong>5. Beware of pickpockets and scams</strong></h4><p>Paris and Italy had the worst pickpocket problems out of the nine countries I visited. Try to keep your bag closed and in front of you at all times, and watch out for strange body contact (i.e. suddenly bumping into you while walking down the stairs in a metro station. I also had a friend who got her wallet pulled out of her bag while dancing in a club). </p>
<p>However, even with caution, things can happen. Therefore it is also good to have backup cards and try not to put all your credit cards and/or important documents in one place.<br>Scams are relatively to recognize but sometimes can catch you by surprise. If anyone solicits for your attention on the street of a popular tourist destination or on public transportation, walk away. </p>
<h4 id="6-Sign-up-for-a-transaction-fee-free-debit-credit-card"><a href="#6-Sign-up-for-a-transaction-fee-free-debit-credit-card" class="headerlink" title="6. Sign up for a transaction fee free debit/credit card"></a><strong>6. Sign up for a transaction fee free debit/credit card</strong></h4><p>I used Charles Schwab, as recommended by a student who studied abroad in the past. There is no fee for swiping your card or for withdrawing cash, regardless of which bank’s ATM you are taking money from. The only thing to be aware of is that it takes four business days before your deposit from another bank arrives in your checking account (if you don’t use CS as your primary banking service provider), so plan ahead when moving money or transfer more than enough in one transaction.   </p>
<h4 id="FOR-THOSE-TRAVELING-LONGER-THAN-TWO-WEEKS"><a href="#FOR-THOSE-TRAVELING-LONGER-THAN-TWO-WEEKS" class="headerlink" title="FOR THOSE TRAVELING LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS"></a><strong>FOR THOSE TRAVELING LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS</strong></h4><p>Data and cellular service: If you start your trip in France, I recommend purchasing a SIM card from Free Mobile. For 19.99 euros, you receive unlimited data, call, and SMS text messaging in France, as well as free calls to the United States and some thirty other countries. Plus, if you travel to other countries, the monthly plan includes calls, pay-per-message texting, and 5GB of 4G data. </p>
<p>If any of the tips made your trip planning easier, please let me know by giving this post a “like” or share it with your friends. Bon voyage! </p>
