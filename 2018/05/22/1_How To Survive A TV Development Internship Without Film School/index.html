If that’s not what you are looking for, close the window now."></a><em>This is a boring career discussion. If that’s not what you are looking for, close the window now.</em></h5><p>&nbsp;<br>Today marks the last day of my TV development apprenticeship. For the past four months, I had the opportunity to work alongside the most talented and charismatic people at an Academy Award-winning documentary production company in New York City. In summary, it was a demanding role that takes a depth and breadth of knowledge about current affairs, pop culture, and copious amount of caffeinating, to thrive. </p>
<h4 id="WHY-DOC"><a href="#WHY-DOC" class="headerlink" title="WHY DOC?"></a>WHY DOC?</h4><p>Since the groundbreaking win of Fahrenheit 9/11 at the Cannes D’or in 2004, a new era for the art commenced. <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2017/04/documentaries-sales-netflix-amazon-hulu-bubble-1201806552/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>IndireWire</em></a> commented that in the past dozen years, “documentary makers are not only picking engaging subjects”, but also “taking pains to pinpoint cinematic moments, using storytelling techniques, pulling the viewer into the investigation, and presenting reality in a raw, real manner which has proven very appealing to the public.” </p>
<p>The growing palate for engaging cinéma vérité has led to a higher pay for nonfiction content and the mushrooming of documentary filmmakers. 2017 perhaps marked one of the industry’s best years. Competitions between SVODs (Subscription Video On Demand) companies such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and broadcasters like NatGeo, CNN, and Showtime have made it a more profitable for documentaries than ever. At the 2017 Tribeca and Sundance Film Festivals, many agencies reported that they had a “banner year”, closing multiple seven-figure deals in a single event. In fact, the market is so hot that even President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama have become players in the game with the announcement of their Netflix producing deal. </p>
<p>A rainforest of production companies exist, but I was mostly interested in the investigative and educational use of the documentary medium. From exposing white collar crime to highlighting the atrocities of the Iraq War, the studio’s slate of politically, socially, and economically poignant content showed the potential of the medium to bring about the impact I hope to make in the future. </p>
<h4 id="THE-JOB"><a href="#THE-JOB" class="headerlink" title="THE JOB"></a>THE JOB</h4><p>Walking into the internship, I was so excited about being part of the dream team that picks up the next <em>Going Clear</em> or <em>Taxi To the Dark Side</em>. However, I quickly learned that although thought-provoking feature films are powerful messages, they cost a lot to make and generally do not turn a profit (unless you are Morgan Spurlock or Michael Moore). Thus, the production’s main focus is to instead develop programming for major networks and SVODs. When I realized this, it was a mild “expectation vs. reality” moment, since so much of the company’s publicity came from the feature films it produced. But with near blank slate on my development experience, I decided to stick around, </p>
<p>As someone who was trained to think economically, it was too easy for me to rationalize and focus on reaching a logical conclusion. While this may be a useful mindset in everyday journalism, rationality is irrelevant when it comes to filmmaking. For this specific art form, you are supposed to let your emotions take control, and let your senses indulge in the subtleties. Whereas other interns who studied TV or film production could instantly isolate the elements that can carry a story, I started out sitting there thinking about how unnecessary it is to sensationalize everything. Then I guiltily recalled that the most addictive shows I’ve watched were on TLC.  </p>
<p>I was immediately introduced to the intensity of what I call the “development hustle”. From day one, the challenge was to write as if I had gone through journalism school, to find or invent show concepts like I went through film school, and to pitch as if I’m on the next episode of Shark Tank – None of which was in my experience. Sounds like an impossible situation, but luckily I was in a position to learn. </p>
<p>So how did I manage sail my ship across the waters and stay afloat? </p>
<p>The most basic tenet of development is writing. During my college years, I spent the majority of my extracurricular time overseeing the editing of interviews for a social media blog, amassing over 10,000 organic Facebook followers in a year. My small success in storytelling paved the way for creative development. Further proving my writing ability with ad-hoc character treatments, I got my foot in the door. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, surviving the pitch meetings was another story. I have summarized a few tips for the aspiring production executives with a non-film background. </p>
<p><strong>Know Your Film references.</strong> Watch a shitload of films, and pay close attention to the stylistic nuances, especially the classics. Heck, even learn a few film <a href="https://reelrundown.com/film-industry/Glossary-of-Film-Terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jargons</a> and be ready to sling them around. </p>
<p><strong>Keep Up With News.</strong> This is particular to documentary filmmaking. After all, there are only so many good real life stories out there. You must know be the first to know them, and be the quickest to get the contacts. </p>
<p><strong>Talk To People.</strong> Media is a word-of-mouth business. Who you know matters much more than what you know. Be curious about other people – ask them questions, invite them for coffee, etc. Charm them with your energy, or a couple witty jokes that you have ready.  This is where it gets unfair. While extroversion comes naturally for some, for many others, it could be intimidating or just disastrous to follow this tip. If you are completely uncomfortable, be yourself. But be encouraged that socializing is a learnable skill. If you have your mind set, there are many ways to improve your conversation making abilities. </p>
<h4 id="FILM-“CAREER-PATH”"><a href="#FILM-“CAREER-PATH”" class="headerlink" title="FILM “CAREER PATH”"></a>FILM “CAREER PATH”</h4><p>This is kind of a misnomer – there is no such thing as a “career path” for the creatives, but there are certain steps to move up the ladder if you are trying to break into the larger productions’ or networks’ for-hire roles. </p>
<p>Interns are unquestionably at the bottom of the food chain. Depending on the circumstances, you may be ordered to buy coffee, CD jackets, go to the dry cleaner’s, etc. Once, I was asked to run 7 blocks to buy a singular boiled egg. But as an intern I also got to pitch to TV executives from major networks. Whatever the situation is, those who go above and beyond will always stand out and be remembered. </p>
<p>Going up, you can start from being a production assistant, an executive assistant, or even a production manager, all of which will expose you to various sides and contacts in the industry. On the producing route, there is researcher, associate producer, producer, line producer, showrunner, executive producer, etc. The directing side is a little different, as your work speaks much more loudly than your experience. Being a director’s assistant may be the best way to learn. </p>
<p>This applies to the production studio side of the business (I’d like to think of it as equivalent to the “sell side” in a stock market). The “buy side”, or the network side of the business, works more similarly to the producing side of productions I mentioned. You can read the many articles available about them by googling “How To Become A TV Network Executive”. </p>
<p>Deciding what the rest of America sees in the media is a powerful position. You can bet that there are people fighting tooth and nail for the job. An important reminder – there is no money or fame in documentary. Exceptions exist for every scenario, but it’s the general rule of this game. Therefore, before you jump in, know what you want. </p>
